Get your heart rate up and prepare your body for movement.\n* **Breakfalls:** Forward roll, backward roll, side breakfall. Mastering these is essential for safe training and will build confidence.\n\n"

Focus on maintaining a tight core and using your legs effectively.\n* **Hip Escapes (Upa):** Practice bridging and escaping from side control. This is your primary escape route from a common dominant position.\n* **Technical Stand-up:** From your knees, practice getting to your feet without using your hands, maintaining a good base and posture. This is crucial for wrestling and transitioning in BJJ.\n* **Penetration Step (Wrestling):** Practice stepping deep into your opponent's space, maintaining a low center of gravity, and driving through your legs.\n* **Sprawl:** React quickly to your opponent's shot by sprawling your legs back and driving your weight down on their back. This is your first line of defense against takedowns.\n* **Guard Passing Drills:** Start with basic passes like the Toreando pass and knee slice pass. Focus on maintaining control and pressure.\n* **Side Control Escape Drills:** Practice bridging and shrimping to create space and regain guard.\n* **Mount Escape Drills:** Upa escape and elbow-knee escape are essential for getting out from under mount.\n\n"

Start slow and gradually increase the intensity as you become more comfortable.\n* **Focus on Technique:** Don't just try to muscle through. Focus on applying the techniques you've drilled.\n\n*Cool-down (5-10 minutes):**\n\n* **Stretching:** Focus on major muscle groups used during training, holding each stretch for 20-30 seconds. This will improve flexibility and reduce muscle soreness.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n* **Consistency is Key:** Train regularly, even if it's just for a short period. Consistent practice will lead to faster progress.\n* **Tap Early, Tap Often:** Don't be afraid to tap out if you're in a bad position or feel pain. Protecting yourself from injury is paramount.\n* **Find a Good Coach:** A qualified instructor can provide personalized guidance and correct your technique.\n* **Listen to Your Body:** Rest when you need to. Overtraining can lead to injuries and burnout.\n* **Have Fun!** Enjoy the process of learning and improving. Jiu-Jitsu and wrestling are challenging but rewarding martial arts.\n\nThis is a sample plan, and you can adjust it based on your individual needs and goals. Remember to listen to your body, train smart, and have fun! Oss!\n"
